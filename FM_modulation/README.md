# Frequency modulation
## Frequency modulation with SDR

![N|Solid](http://www.physics-and-radio-electronics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frequencymodulation.png)

This work shows several examples of how to perform frequency modulation using GNU radio and implementing them in an SDR 

### Topics 
This section will show how to manipulate the Frequency  of the carrier signal to transmit information, at first it will show the simulation and then we will use the SDR to transmit the information.
- **Frequency modulation**
     - FM
     - NBFM --> (Narrow band frequency modulation)
     - VCO
     - WBFM --> (Wide band frequency modulation)



## Important!
keep in mind that when an audio is transmitted, it **MUST BE** on your computer, to record an audio it is recommended to use the Audacity software
